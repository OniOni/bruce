Todo:
- Groups (aka metatasks)
- File groups
- Allow per task fingerprinting strategy
- Allow users to hook up custom fingerprinting strategies

Done:
- Task should become invalidated if config changes
- We should allow running specific tasks from CLI
- Package up
- Write bootstrapping script
- better error handling
