Todo:
- Allow users to hook up custom fingerprinting strategies
- Support config via pyproject.toml and env variables
- Support anonymous watches (glob/file)
- Allow tasks to be watched by downstream tasks

Done:
- Task should become invalidated if config changes
- We should allow running specific tasks from CLI
- Package up
- Write bootstrapping script
- better error handling
- Groups (aka metatasks)
- File groups (globs)
- Allow per task fingerprinting strategy
